``` r
set.seed(1)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

### Problem 1

``` r
fill_data = function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  } else if (is.character(x)) {
    replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}

iris = map_df(iris_with_missing, fill_data)
```

### Problem 2

``` r
path = str_c("./data/", list.files("./data/")) 
file_name = list.files("./data/")

vec_file_name = 
  tibble( 
    path = path[1:20], 
    file_name = file_name[1:20]
)

pcpt_data_tidy =
  purrr::map_df(vec_file_name$path, read_csv) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  cbind(file_name = vec_file_name$file_name) %>% 
  separate(file_name, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(id, into = c("id_num", "remove"), sep = 2) %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "obsv",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>% 
 select(arm, id_num, week, obsv)
```
