``` r
set.seed(1)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

### Problem 1

The purpose of this function is to fill in missing data of the dataset
presented. Below we are replacing numeric vectors with mean of the
column and character vectors with plant species viriginica.

``` r
fill_data = function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  } else if (is.character(x)) {
    replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}

iris = map_df(iris_with_missing, fill_data)
```

### Problem 2

Creating a list named `file_name` from the directory.

``` r
path = str_c("./data/", list.files("./data/")) 
file_name = list.files("./data/")
```

Making a table with 2 columns: `file_name` and its `path`.

``` r
vec_file_name = 
  tibble( 
    path = path[1:20], 
    file_name = file_name[1:20]
)
```

Tidying data: Using `purrr` function to map and read csv data from file
paths, and then unnesting the data using `unnest()`. Next cleaned
variable names using `seperate` and changing the structure from wide to
long.

``` r
pcpt_data_tidy =
  purrr::map_df(vec_file_name$path, read_csv) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  cbind(file_name = vec_file_name$file_name) %>% 
  separate(file_name, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(id, into = c("id_num", "remove"), sep = 2) %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "obsv",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>% 
 select(arm, id_num, week, obsv)
```

Creating a ggplot comparind the change in observed values between the
subject of treatment and control arm over the weeks.

``` r
pcpt_data_tidy %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(arm_id = paste(arm, id_num, sep = "_")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obsv, color = arm, group = arm_id)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(
      title = "Observations on each subject over time",
      x = "Week Number",
      y = "Observation",
      color = 'Arm'
    ) 
```

### Problem 3:

The function below simulates a regression model for y, where x is a
random normal variable of n = 30, intercept of 2 and variance of 50, in
a range of 0 to variance. `ls_fit` is the regression model and the
corresponding estimated beta and p-value are listed in the table.

``` r
set.seed(1)

sim_reg = function(beta1 = 0) {
  
  sim_regression = tibble(
    x = rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 2),
    y = 2 + beta1 * x + rnorm(30, 0, sd = 50^(1/2))
      )
  
  ls_fit = lm(y ~ x, data = sim_regression)
  
  tibble(
    beta1_hat = broom::tidy(ls_fit)[2, 2] %>% as.numeric(),
    p_value = broom::tidy(ls_fit)[2, 5] %>% as.numeric()
  )
}
```

Runing the model for values of beta 1 = 0 to 6, 10,000 times for each
value of beta using the above function. The results are will be listed
in the results table.

``` r
set.seed(1)

results = tibble(beta_1 = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>% 
  mutate(output_lists = map(.x = beta_1, ~rerun(10000, sim_reg(beta1 = .x))),
         estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)) %>%
  select(-output_lists) %>%
  unnest(estimate_dfs)
```

Graphing the beta1 values with the percent at which null is rejected for
each beta1.

``` r
results %>% 
  group_by(beta_1) %>%
  count(reject = p_value < 0.05) %>% 
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n)*100) %>% 
  filter(reject == TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = beta_1, y = percent)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```

Comparing geometric lines of graph between mean estimated values for a
corresponding beta and graph of mean estimated values for which p\<0.05
and corresponding beta. We could see that there is difference in mean
values and, and the means are different from each other. While one is a
straight line the other is a curve.

``` r
results %>% 
  group_by(beta_1) %>%
  mutate(mean1 = mean(beta1_hat)) %>% 
  mutate(mean2 = mean(beta1_hat[which(p_value < 0.05)])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beta_1)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = mean1, color = "Mean of beta_1 hat")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean2, color = "Mean of beta_1 hat for p-value <0.05")) +
    labs(
    title = "Graph of Beta 1 and Means of estimated values",
    x = "Value of Beta 1",
    y = "Mean of Estimated beta"
  ) 
```
